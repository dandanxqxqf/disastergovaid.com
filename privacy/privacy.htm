 privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this 
Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate 
and make use of personal information. The following outlines our Privacy
 Policy.<br><br>When accessing our Website,&nbsp;Disastergovaid.com will learn certain information about you during your visit.<br><br>Similar
 to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard 
technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?")
 and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is

include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our

computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive 
specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own

 cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by 
other sites.<br><br>IP Addresses<br>IP addresses are used by your 
computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address 
is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your

 online, mail and telephone.<br><br>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?<br>Broadly

 may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other 
words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for 
the protection of our legal rights.<br><br>A Special Note About Children<br>Children
